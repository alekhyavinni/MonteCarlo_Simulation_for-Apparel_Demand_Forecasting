# Monte Carlo Simulation for Apparel Demand Forecasting
Developed a Monte Carlo-based forecasting pipeline for XYZ Apparel Ltd. to model multi-source demand uncertainty including order frequency, item selection, quantity, and lead time using time series, classification, and empirical distribution techniques.

## üìã Overview

This project addresses demand forecasting and uncertainty modeling in the apparel industry using a **Monte Carlo Simulation** approach. The dataset used is transactional in nature and includes customer purchase records over time.

The project has three main components:

1. **Monthly Order Forecasting**  
   Using time-series analysis to predict the number of **distinct monthly orders** based on unique order codes grouped by order dates.

2. **Product Choice Modeling**  
   Building a **classification model** to analyze customer **product selection** behavior. This model incorporates **seasonality** as a key feature, with categorical encoding techniques such as one-hot encoding applied.

3. **Uncertainty Quantification**  
   - Quantity demanded per product is characterized using **empirical quantiles**.
   - Demand **lead time** is similarly analyzed using empirical distributions.
   - These uncertainties are integrated using **Monte Carlo Simulation** to simulate total demand under varied conditions.

## üìä Output Insights

- **Forecasted Order Volumes**: Expected monthly demand trend
- **Product Choice Behavior**: Feature importance in product selection
- **Demand Type Split**:
  - Advance Demand: Known before deadline
  - Urgent Demand: Late-stage demand requiring rush production
